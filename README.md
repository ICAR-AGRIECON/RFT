## User Manual of RFT: Review File Transcoder

The RFT: Review File Transcoder software streamlines the process of managing bibliographic data by enabling easy format conversions between .ris, .csv, and .xlsx files. Researchers can quickly import and export citations, making collaboration and data sharing more efficient. This flexibility allows users to manipulate and analyse data in familiar spreadsheet environments. It also enhances compatibility with various reference management tools, improving workflow efficiency. Overall, the  software simplifies the handling of academic references, saving time and reducing the risk of errors. Here’s a breakdown of the file types involved:

1. .ris Files - Usage: RIS (Research Information Systems) files are used for sharing bibliographic information, primarily among reference management software. They typically contain metadata about research articles, books, and other sources, including titles, authors, publication dates, and abstracts. Benefit: By converting to .ris, users can easily import citations into reference management tools like EndNote, Zotero, or Mendeley.

2. .csv Files: Usage: CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are commonly used for data exchange, particularly in spreadsheet applications. They can hold tabular data and are widely supported by various software, including Excel and Google Sheets. Benefit: Converting .ris to .csv allows users to manipulate bibliographic data in spreadsheet applications for analysis, sorting, and organization.

3. .xlsx Files: Usage: XLSX files are a more advanced spreadsheet format used by Microsoft Excel. They can store complex data structures, including multiple sheets, formulas, and formatting. Benefit: Similar to .csv, converting .xlsx to .ris makes it easier to share and manage bibliographic data in reference managers while retaining the advantages of a structured spreadsheet.
